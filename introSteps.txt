NOTE: if you are on a mac, make sure that you use the python3 command rather than just python

1. Have a virtual environment ready for Django. Create and activate the environment.
    1.5 Check out this page on virtual environment commands: http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/119/6127/42500

2. Ensure Django is installed. Check "pip list" or run "pip install Django==2.2.4"

3. Once you are sure your environment is active and Django is installed, navigate to the folder where you want your project

4. Run "django-admin startproject name_of_proj"

5. Navigate into /name_of_proj, run "ls" or "dir" to ensure you can see manage.py

6. Run "python manage.py runserver" and check localhost:8000 to see the basic Django screen.
    6.5 If you don't see the basic Django screen then check over to make sure you missed nothing

7. ctrl+c to quit your server. Then run "python manage.py startapp name_of_app"

8. Open the main project folder(the one holding manage.py) in VS Code

9. Open name_of_proj/settings.py

10. Add 'name_of_app' to list of INSTALLED_APPS

11. Open name_of_proj/urls.py

12. Make sure all the code matches the following(double check if you renamed the app):
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('name_of_app.urls'))
]

13. Create a new file within the name_of_app folder. Call the file "urls.py"

14. The code in this file should match the following exactly:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index),
]


15. Open name_of_app/views.py

16. views.py should match the following code exactly:
from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("hello from the Django app!")

17. Run the file from the same folder as manage.py again. "python manage.py runserver" and check in your browser at localhost:8000
